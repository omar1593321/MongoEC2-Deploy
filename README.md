MongoDB Deployment on EKS with Mongo Express ðŸš€

Welcome to my project, where I deployed MongoDB with Mongo Express on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). This guide will walk you through the setup, deployment, and configuration of this stateful application on a managed Kubernetes service.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

In this project, I utilized Amazon EKS to deploy a MongoDB database and the Mongo Express web-based admin interface. The setup includes configuring persistent storage, network services, and addressing deployment challenges, all while leveraging the power of AWSâ€™s managed Kubernetes service.

ðŸ”§ Key Features

    Amazon EKS Setup: Detailed instructions on setting up Amazon EKS, including creating a cluster and configuring kubectl to interact with it.
    
    Persistent Storage: Implemented PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) and PersistentVolumes (PV) to ensure data persistence for MongoDB.
    
    Service Exposure: Configured Kubernetes services for MongoDB and Mongo Express to allow secure and reliable external access.
    
    Troubleshooting and Optimization: Documented challenges such as pod scheduling and node capacity constraints, with solutions applied to ensure smooth operation.
    

ðŸ›  Getting Started

Prerequisites:

    An AWS account with permissions to create and manage EKS clusters, EC2 instances, and other resources.
    
    AWS CLI installed and configured.
    
    eksctl and kubectl installed.

Setup Instructions:

    Create an EKS Cluster:
    
    Use eksctl to create an EKS cluster:

   ```

eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region <region> --nodes 2

```
Configure kubectl:
Ensure kubectl is configured to interact with your new EKS cluster:

bash

aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster

Deploy MongoDB and Mongo Express:
Apply the Kubernetes YAML files for MongoDB and Mongo Express:

bash

kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-express-deployment.yaml

Verify the Deployment:
Check the status of the pods, services, and persistent volumes:

bash

    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get pv

    Access Mongo Express:
    Find the external IP or port of the Mongo Express service and navigate to it in your web browser to manage your MongoDB instance.

Configuration Files:

    MongoDB Deployment YAML: Includes configurations for persistent storage and environment variables.
    Mongo Express Deployment YAML: Configures the web-based admin interface and service exposure.

ðŸš€ Usage

    Manage MongoDB: Use Mongo Express to manage your MongoDB instance through a web interface.
    Monitor the Cluster: Utilize EKS monitoring tools and kubectl to keep an eye on cluster health and performance.

ðŸ“œ Troubleshooting

    Pod Scheduling Issues: Address scheduling constraints by reviewing node capacity and resource requests.
    Data Persistence: Ensure PersistentVolumeClaims are properly bound to PersistentVolumes and check logs for any related errors.
